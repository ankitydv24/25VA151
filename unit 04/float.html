    <p>Ram Mandir, Ayodhya, a grand Hindu temple inaugurated on January 22, 2024, at a site in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, believed to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram. The site is where the Babri Masjid, a Mughal-era mosque, stood until December 6, 1992, when Hindu activists destroyed the mosque and tensions between religious groups led to rioting throughout the country.

The site at which the Ram Mandir stands has long been an area of conflict. The Hindu community considers it Ram Janmabhoomi, or Ram’s birthplace, while the Muslim community holds it sacred as the spot where the 16th-century Babri Masjid stood, and numerous lawsuits were filed by both communities for possession of the site. A court ruling in 2010 divided the land between Hindus and Muslims, but that decision was overturned in 2019 by the Supreme Court of India, which entrusted the site exclusively to Hindus and directed the state to grant an alternate site in Ayodhya to the Muslim community.

Consecration ceremony and temple inauguration
The temple’s consecration ceremony, or prana pratishtha (establishment of life force), held on January 22, 2024, was attended by about 7,000 guests, including Bollywood celebrities, prominent athletes, business moguls, and spiritual leaders, among others. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided at the ceremony. The inauguration day was a widely publicized and intensively marketed event. The day after the temple’s inauguration, roughly 300,000 devotees thronged the temple for darshan (divine vision) of the newly installed murti (devotional image) of Ram Lalla, a five-year-old Ram. An equal number of people were said to have been waiting outside for a turn to see the image.

Temple design, architecture, and plan
The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, set up by the Government of India, is responsible for the construction and management of the temple. The main temple is built over 2.7 acres (1.1 hectares), and the temple complex is spread over an area of 70 acres (28 hectares). Work on the temple and the surrounding complex was completed in phases. The construction of the temple’s ground floor, with the garbhagriha (“womb room”) for the deity, was completed in time for the consecration ceremony in 2024, a year in which India also had its Lok Sabha elections. The temple complex’s construction was officially marked as completed at an event on November 25, 2025, where Prime Minister Modi hoisted a ceremonial saffron flag (the color saffron is associated with Hinduism by many, is used in the Indian national flag, and is the color of the flag used by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh).

The main temple has three floors, going up to a total height of 161 feet (49 meters). It is 360 feet (110 meters) long and 235 feet (72 meters) wide. The temple features 5 congregation halls (mandapas) and 12 gates. Designed by architect Chandrakant Sompura and his son Ashish Sompura, the temple is built in the Nagara style of architecture, similar to the Sun Temple at Konark, Odisha. The Nagara style is characterized by its distinctive shikhara—that is, a superstructure, tower, or spire above the garbhagriha. The spire and the garbhagriha of the Ram temple have a unique octagonal shape, unlike the traditional square-shaped garbhagrihas. Although no iron or steel has been used to build the temple, it is expected to withstand natural calamities for the next 2,500 years because it has undergone 3D structural analysis, according to Ashish Sompura. Pink sandstone from Bansi Paharpur and marble from Makrana, both in the state of Rajasthan, have been used to construct the temple. The temple complex is designed to have lifts and ramps for people with mobility difficulties, a sewage treatment plant, a water treatment plant, and a power station. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust plans to keep a large green area constituting about 70 percent of the complex and to conserve environmental water.
